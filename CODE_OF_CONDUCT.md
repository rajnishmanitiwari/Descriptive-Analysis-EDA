We, as contributors and maintainers, are committed to making participation in our project a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

- Being respectful and considerate of others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being helpful and constructive
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of offensive language or imagery, personal attacks, trolling, or public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, and any other spaces the project uses for communication and collaboration. It also applies when representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
